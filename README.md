# Portal 2 Example Mod
 A sample mod for Portal 2, to quickly get started.

## Installation
Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/CheeseInSpace/Portal2-Example-Mod/wiki/Getting-Started) for information about instalation

## Notes
Maps go into the "maps" folder. Currently, in the chapter menu, "Chapter 1" leads to the map "sp_a1_00". Everything in this mod should be reconfigured anyway, however -- don't just use the placeholder images!
